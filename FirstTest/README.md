# First Test

This is the first test that the team should run to check if everything works after Calabash has been setup.


## Run the application

The feature file contains basic steps like run the app and wait for a timeout. If both tests succeed Calabash is configured correctly and you can proceed with the other tests

    Given my app is running
    Then I wait 5 seconds
